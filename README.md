# Huawei-Ireland-Hackathon-2024

  This has been an attempt to compete in the Huawei Ireland Hackathon. This has been a team effort with the collaborators of this project. 
  Sadly, we did not manage to get past the first part of the competition. If you wish to see the first step of the Hackathon, 
  documentation about the first stage are available on this repository.

## Contributions

  with Theon providing alternate methods of developiing our solution.
